# History doesn't matter

- Java was created in 1995 at Sun Microsystems for interactive television.

- Python was created in 1991 for Amoeba OS (a distributed operating system) which was not continued after a few versions.

- Lua was created in 1993 as an embeddable scripting language for extending applications. Now it is really big in the Gaming industry.
