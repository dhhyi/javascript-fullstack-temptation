- pages use heavy frameworks

- a lot of JavaScript is needed to run the pages

- Studies show that users will leave if a page takes more than 3 seconds to load

# Webpages can be optimized

<v-clicks>

- use tools like Lighthouse to analyze performance

- if used correctly, frameworks use code-splitting and tree-shaking

- use CDN to deliver static assets

- configure caching correctly

- use SSR (server-side rendering) or SSG (static site generation)

- ship less initial JavaScript

  - use server components (React)

  - incremental hydration (Angular)
